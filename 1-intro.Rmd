# Introduction

International student migration refers to students crossing national borders to enrol in educational institutions abroad [@king2013international; @gumus2020review]. In Europe, this migration includes various levels of education, from primary and secondary to tertiary and vocational training [@epc2006]. Over recent decades, the trend of students seeking educational opportunities beyond their home countries has grown and evolved significantly [@OECD2022]. Factors such as the desire for quality education, cultural exposure, improved career prospects, and personal development often motivate this international journey [e.g., @beine2014determinants; @trower2017strategic; @mazzarol2002push]. International student flows have become a crucial component of the education sector and have substantial implications for sending and receiving countries.

Countries sending students often benefit from the money and skills that students send back home, boosting economic development and building capacity. Conversely, the countries where students go to study gain from the increased cultural diversity, the exchange of ideas, and the economic boost that comes from having international students. However, if student migration flows are not carefully managed, there exists a risk of exacerbating global inequalities in skills and development. The phenomenon known as brain drain, as described by @robertson2006brain, underscores the potential negative consequences of imbalanced mobility flows, such as leading to a concentration of talent in certain regions, contributing to disparities in skills and hindering the progress of less favored nations.

This report reviews the academic literature to analyse the factors driving student mobility, especially in Europe, while also considering experiences from other regions where relevant. It will explore key questions such as what influences students' decision to study abroad and how they select their destination country. By addressing these questions, the literature review aims to paint a detailed picture of International Student Mobility (ISM) in Europe and beyond, shedding light on the overarching trends and motivations of individuals studying abroad. 

The review is organised into four key sections. [Section 2](#sec:flows) provides an update on European student migration, complete with data and trends. [Section 3](#sec:theories) dives into various theories about ISM, presenting real-world examples to illustrate how these theories have been employed to understand better why students choose to study abroad. This section will also discuss the demographic and socio-economic factors that affect student mobility decisions. [Section 4](#sec:credits) clarifies the distinction between 'credit mobility', where students go abroad briefly, often as part of an exchange program, and 'degree mobility', where students relocate to pursue an entire degree program in a foreign country. Lastly, [Section 5](#sec:conclusion) concludes our literature review by summarising the main ideas discussed and drawing some conclusions.
